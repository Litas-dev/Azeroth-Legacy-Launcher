Relictum Launcher: A New Era for Classic Gaming - Major GUI Overhaul Revealed!

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share a massive update we've been working on for the **Relictum Launcher**. We've completely overhauled the interface to bring you a modern, secure, and seamless experience for managing your classic WoW journey.

**✨ What's New in the GUI Rework:**

*   **Cinematic Dashboard:** A completely redesigned home screen featuring a sleek, immersive "Hero" layout with dynamic background branding.
*   **Modern Aesthetics:** We've adopted a clean, glassmorphic design language with professional typography and polished animations. It feels premium and responsive.
*   **Unified Hub:** Managing multiple expansions (Classic, TBC, WotLK), addons, and settings is now smoother than ever. Everything you need is just one click away.
*   **Enhanced Readability:** Improved contrast, text scaling, and layout adjustments ensure important information is always clear.

**🔒 Under the Hood:**
Beyond the visuals, we've optimized the launcher for better performance and security, ensuring your gateway to Azeroth is stable and safe.
